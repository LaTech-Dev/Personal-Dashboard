         Setting Up a Localhost with Python HTTP Server

Navigate to Your Project Folder:
Open Terminal.
Use the cd command to navigate to the folder where your website or project files are stored.

        cd /Users/your user name/Desktop/Desktop Folders/TableViewer

*****Note:  use a \ to escape the space.  cd /Users/joehood/Desktop/Desktop\ Folders/TableViewer



              Start the Server (Python 3.x):

If you are using Python 3, use the following command to start the local server:

        python3 -m http.server 8000

This will start a server on port 8000, which is commonly used for local development.



                Access the Local Server:

Open your web browser and go to:

        http://localhost:8000/


You should now see your files being served locally! You can click on your HTML files, and they will render right in your browser.



                  Stopping the Server:
To stop the server, simply go back to your Terminal and press Ctrl + C.
